# 🔧 Improvements & Roadmap

## 🎯 Current Status

Excellent — your current Student API is already a **solid CRUD foundation** 👏

Now, expanding it depends on *what direction you want to take it* — for example: learning-focused, production-style, or feature-rich.

Let's go through **how you can expand it meaningfully**, grouped by goals 👇

## 🚨 Critical Security Vulnerabilities

### High Priority
- **CWE-79: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** - Multiple instances in `student.go`
  - Lines 43-44, 57-58, 68-69, 105-106, 121-122
  - **Fix**: Sanitize all user inputs before storing/displaying
  - **Impact**: Attackers can inject malicious scripts

- **CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data** - `student.go:23-24`
  - **Fix**: Add input size limits, validate JSON structure
  - **Impact**: Potential DoS or code execution

- **Inadequate Error Handling** - `sqlite.go`, `main.go`, `student.go`
  - Missing error checks in critical database operations
  - **Fix**: Wrap errors with context, handle all error paths
  - **Impact**: Silent failures, data corruption

### Medium Priority
- **Performance Issues** - `main.go:39-43`
  - No database connection pooling
  - **Fix**: Configure `db.SetMaxOpenConns()`, `db.SetMaxIdleConns()`

- **SQL Injection Prevention** - `sqlite.go:61-62`
  - Currently using prepared statements (good), but add query validation
  - **Fix**: Add input validation layer

## 🏗️ Architectural Improvements

### 1. Add Middleware Layer
```
internal/middleware/
├── logger.go       # Request/response logging
├── cors.go         # CORS configuration
├── auth.go         # JWT authentication
├── ratelimit.go    # Rate limiting
└── recovery.go     # Panic recovery
```

### 2. Separate Concerns
```
internal/
├── dto/            # Data Transfer Objects
│   ├── request.go
│   └── response.go
├── service/        # Business logic layer
│   └── student/
│       └── service.go
├── repository/     # Rename storage to repository
└── errors/         # Custom error types
    └── errors.go
```

### 3. Add Router Package
```
internal/http/
├── router/
│   └── router.go   # Centralized routing
└── handlers/
```

### 4. Database Migrations
```
migrations/
├── 000001_create_students_table.up.sql
├── 000001_create_students_table.down.sql
└── README.md
```

### 5. Testing Infrastructure
```
tests/
├── integration/
│   └── student_test.go
└── mocks/
    └── storage_mock.go

internal/*/
└── *_test.go       # Unit tests alongside code
```

## 🧱 Advanced CRUD Features

These make your API more realistic and robust:

| Feature | Endpoint | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Search students** | `GET /api/students?name=John` | Filter by name, email, or age range. |
| **Pagination** | `GET /api/students?page=1&limit=10` | Add paging for large datasets. |
| **Sorting** | `GET /api/students?sort=age&order=desc` | Sort results dynamically. |
| **Partial update (PATCH)** | `PATCH /api/students/{id}` | Update only specific fields. |
| **Bulk delete** | `DELETE /api/students` | Delete multiple IDs at once. |
| **Count endpoint** | `GET /api/students/count` | Get total number of students. |

These are great if you want to learn **REST design best practices**.

## 🧠 Add Related Entities

Add more tables and relationships — perfect for learning **SQL joins** and API structure.

| Entity | Example Relationship | Example Endpoints |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Courses** | A student can have multiple courses. | `/api/students/{id}/courses` |
| **Departments** | A student belongs to one department. | `/api/departments/{id}/students` |
| **Attendance / Grades** | One-to-many relation. | `/api/students/{id}/grades` |

➡️ You'll get to learn how to **design relational schemas**, use `JOIN`s, and structure handlers for nested resources.

## 🧩 DevOps / Production Level Enhancements

Since you want to be a **DevOps + Backend engineer**, this level will help you shine.

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|----------|
| **Add logging middleware** | Structured logs for requests/responses. |
| **Add authentication (JWT)** | Protect routes like POST/PUT/DELETE. |
| **Add rate limiting** | Learn how to protect APIs from abuse. |
| **Add metrics (Prometheus)** | Monitor API performance. |
| **Add Dockerfile & docker-compose** | Containerize your backend. |
| **Add CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)** | Automate build/test/deploy. |

This turns your Student API into a **mini professional project** you can showcase.

## 💡 Frontend Layer (Optional but Impressive)

Even a simple frontend makes it stand out.

- Build a small **React or Vue dashboard** to:
  - Add/edit students
  - View list & search
  - Delete and update entries
- Or just use **HTMX** + Go templates for a lightweight interface.

## 🏁 Example Future API Map

Here's how your API could look after expansion:

```
/api/students
├── POST /api/students
├── GET /api/students
├── GET /api/students/{id}
├── PUT /api/students/{id}
├── PATCH /api/students/{id}
├── DELETE /api/students/{id}
├── GET /api/students/search?name=John
├── GET /api/students/count
├── GET /api/students/{id}/courses
└── POST /api/students/{id}/courses
```
